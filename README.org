This repository is for experimenting with git and GitHub.

It is public repository in that it can be forked and cloned anytime, but I treat it as if it were a private repository.

In particular,

- I routinely update the repository with
   : git push --force origin <SOME-BRANCH>
- I close all pull requests automatically;
- I have disabled GitHub's =Issues= feature.

Also, FWIW: there's no =master= branch, or anything like it.  It's all topic branches.
